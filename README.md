# UrbanSound8K Dataset Sound Classification
- <b>Dataset:</b> [UrbanSound8K](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html)
- <b>Dataset Description:</b> This dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music. The classes are drawn from the urban sound taxonomy.
- [CreateSpectrogram](https://github.com/fatihsen20/GlobalAIHubBootcamp/blob/main/createSpectrogram.ipynb): Selects audio files in .wav format. It then converts these audio files into "spectrogram" graphics. It saves these graphics in folders according to their class in .png format.
- [Preprocessing](https://github.com/fatihsen20/GlobalAIHubBootcamp/blob/main/preprocessing.ipynb): We read the spectrogram charts we created. We resize, normalize and grayscale on these files and add them to a list. We shuffle the data so that it is not ordered. We split our dataset to prepare the data for processing. We save the data to a file.
- [Model](https://github.com/fatihsen20/GlobalAIHubBootcamp/blob/main/hyperparameterOptimization.ipynb): We are creating a CNN model. We measure the training performance of our model. For hyperparameter optimization, we use different activation functions and compare model performances.
